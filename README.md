VSC test suite

# How to run the tests (new)

run script that works recursively

```
cd vsc-test-suite
./run.sh
```

TODO
- --prefix is set to $HOME in order to not have conflicts between different users (write permissions of log files mainly). needs improvement.
- need confirmation it works on other sites as well
